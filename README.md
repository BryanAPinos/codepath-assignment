Submitted by: **Bryan Pinos**

Time spent: **1** hours spent in total

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [Y] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [Y] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [Y] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [Y] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [Y] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [Y] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [Y] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [Y] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [Y] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [N] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [N] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [N] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [N] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [N] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [N] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [N] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!
  - Could make difficulty options, such as increasing the speed that the hints play at
  - Along with the difficulty, could have multiple length patterns to choose from, ranging from 8 to more.

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
[No outside resources used]

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
[Working with audio was new to me. So it took me some time to understand the adding audio section from the website. I kept going through it carefully to understand the code line by line.]

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[How do you go through your process prior coding? While this question doesn't match with this assignment, I'm curious as the the steps that are needed to be able to develop a website as smoothly and successfully as possible.]

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[Stated above in what else could be done, I would add difficulty features for users to choose their level of difficulty. Such as shorter hint speeds and longer patterns.]
